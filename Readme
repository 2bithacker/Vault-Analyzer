Please use Keep/Favorite/Archive and Junk tags on your weapons and armor.

I've catagorized the contents of this GitHub, refer to the list below:

1. Filter Builder - A spreadsheet you can use to design your own filters, everything is automatically compiled, you just put in the settings you want. Includes pre-made filter, an alternative to the Master Filter.
2. Master Filter - Pre-Made Filter that should work for just about anyone. Conditions described below.
3. Class Stat Catalogue - Set of filters you can use to highlight armor you could utilize for builds, highlights the good stuff.
4. Master Filter Modules - List of Modules used for the Master Filter

TMMania's Master Filter: One-Stop-Shop command for cleaning your vault, highlights your trash. 

This filter will keep armor under the following conditions:
- Tagged: Keep / Favorite / Archive: (Sunset armor without tags will be highlighted)
- Highest Light Level items (Armor and Weapons, one of each slot)
- All Exotics (Weapons and Armor) 
- Loadout Items
- Titan: 18+ Recovery
- Hunter: (18+ Mobility and 13+ recovery)  or (18+ Recovery) 
- Warlock: (17+ Discipline and 18+ recovery)
- All armor with 63+ stat rolls (keep reading)
- 15/20 Stat Pair w/ MW
- Triple 15 Stat Set w/ MW 
- Equal Stat Distribution
- One of every class item, use Keep tag to save additional copies.

Weapons:
- Does not have any filtering for perks.
- Weapons that are sunset or have the Junk tag or blues will be highlighted to be dismantled while ignoring max LL items.
- Pinnacles, Rituals and all MW'ed weapons that are sunset will be ignored.

You can specify the minimum stat roll for each class type in the last section of the rows with is:titan is:warlock.
I have it set to 63 for all, I set it to 65 for my main and 63 for alt characters.

15/20 Pair: Armor that has 20 in one stat and 15 in another.

15 Triple: Armor that has 15 in 3 separate stats

Full House: Armor with an equal stat split

Note: The All-in-One filter utilizes the broader filter that reduces the 15/20 pair and 15 triple to 13/18 pair and 13 triple to allow Masterwork to fill in those gaps.

New Weapon Sorting: For looking at weapons that you haven't inspected yet. This has 2 requirements: New Item Dots option turned on and never click a weapon in DIM, if you do click on a weapon, mark it junk if you don't want it.

Hands On New Weapon Sorting: This filter relies on having tags on all of your weapons, very hands on but nothing will slip through if you accidentally click on anything like with the other "New Weapon Filter"
