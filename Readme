Please use Keep/Favorite/Archive and Junk tags on your weapons and armor.

I've catagorized the contents of this GitHub, refer to the list below:

1. Vault Filter - Pre-Made Filter that should work for just about anyone. Conditions described below the "-" separator.
                  Beta: Just has changes I'll be making before putting them in the full branch. Won't be used too often.
                  Current Beta differences: New class item search for transmog.

2. Filter Builder - A spreadsheet you can use to design your own Vault filters, everything is automatically compiled, you just put 
                    in the settings you want. Includes pre-made filter, an alternative to the Vault Filter.
                    
3. Useful Searches - Set of filters you can use for specific functions, instructions may be inside. In my opinion, the averages searches are far superior to the "Stat Check" options.
                     "Stat Check" checks each stat individually, "Averages" takes an average of the stats and "Summation" takes a sum of the listed stats.
4. Filter Modules - List of Modules, some are in the Vault Filter
5. Depreciated/Less Useful Searches - Older/depreciated searches. Searches are put here when I develop a more effective option which will be in category #3 or #4.
                                      Note: Filters labeled "Stat Check" check each stat individually, the new versions utilize averaging which is more effective.

(Note: The non-numbered versions of the files are just there to maintain older links, these are identical to the numbered versions.)

TMMania's Vault Filter: One-Stop-Shop command for cleaning your vault, highlights your trash. 

This filter will keep armor under the following conditions:
- Tagged: Keep / Favorite / Archive: (Sunset armor without tags will be highlighted)
- Highest Light Level items (Armor and Weapons, one of each slot)
- All Exotics (Weapons and Armor) 
- Loadout Items
- Titan: 18+ Recovery
- Hunter: (18+ Mobility and 13+ recovery)  or (18+ Recovery) 
- Warlock: 18+ recovery
- All armor with 63+ stat rolls (keep reading)
- 15/20 Stat Pair w/ MW
- Triple 15 Stat Set w/ MW 
- Equal Stat Distribution
- One of every class item, use Keep tag to save additional copies.

Weapons:
- Does not have any filtering for perks.
- Weapons that are sunset or have the Junk tag or blues will be highlighted to be dismantled while ignoring max LL items.
- Pinnacles, Rituals and all MW'ed weapons that are sunset will be ignored.

You can specify the minimum stat roll for each class type in the last section of the rows with is:titan is:warlock.
I have it set to 63 for all, I set it to 65 for my main and 63 for alt characters.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


15/20 Pair: Armor that has 20 in one stat and 15 in another.

15 Triple: Armor that has 15 in 3 separate stats

Full House: Armor with an equal stat split

Triple Stat Summations: [BETA DIM ONLY] Tests for armor that the base value of 3 stats add up to >40, using all combinations of 3 stats together. To add this to your Vault Filter, make sure you add a "-" (subtraction sign) to the very start of this module and paste it in between the other two big modules. 

New Weapon Sorting: For looking at weapons that you haven't inspected yet. This has 2 requirements: New Item Dots option turned on and never click a weapon in DIM, if you do click on a weapon, mark it junk if you don't want it.

Hands On New Weapon Sorting: This filter relies on having tags on all of your weapons, very hands on but nothing will slip through if you accidentally click on anything like with the other "New Weapon Filter"
