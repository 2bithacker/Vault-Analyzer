I've catagorized the contents of this GitHub, refer to the list below:


1. Vault Analyzer and DIM Search Gallery Google Sheets:

Instructions for the Vault Analyzer and its conditions are in the google sheets.
This google sheets allows me to avoid instructions in the search modules to allow easy "select all" controls on mobile when copying searches.

If you're sharing my Vault Analyzer, please use the Google Sheets link.


2. Searches - 
Includes the Vault Analyzer and the New Items Checker.                


3. Stat Summation Searches:
Searches that add up the values of all combinations of stats for double and triple stat groups.


4. Stat Average Searches:
Searches that average the stats of all combinations of stats for double, triple and 6 stat groups.
I personally prefer averages over summations, but they should function similarly.

5. Archived Searches:
Older/depreciated searches, I wouldn't use these. Searches are put here when I develop a more effective option which will be in the other categories.
Note: Filters labeled "Stat Check" check each stat individually, the new versions utilize averaging which is far more effective.


Note:
The Filter Builder is no longer public, I've decided to pull support for this as it can be a lot of effort to upkeep and has a far higher risk of bugs.
You can contact me in the DIM Discord about the Filter Builder if you really need it, but for now the Vault Filter has far less flaws than the initial release.
