This filter will keep/ignore:
- **Tagged: Keep / Favorite / Archive [Please Use Tags]**
- Highest Light Level items (Armor and Weapons, one of each slot)
- All Exotics (Weapons and Armor) 
- Loadout Items
- Titan: 18+ Recovery
- Hunter: (18+ Mobility **and** 13+ recovery)  __or__ (18+ Recovery) 
- Warlock: (18+ Discipline **and** 17+ recovery)
- All armor with 63+ stat rolls (keep reading)
- 15/20 Stat Pair w/ MW
- Triple 15 Stat Set w/ MW 
- Equal Stat Distribution
- One of every class item. Again, please use Keep / Favorite / Archive Tags

Weapons:
- Highlights Sunset Items that are not masterworked, use the Keep / Favorite / Archive tags to ignore these items
- Pinnacles, Rituals and all MW'ed weapons that are sunset will be ignored.
- Using the Junk tag on weapons will result in them being highlighted.

You can specify the minimum stat roll for each class type in the last section of the rows with is:titan is:warlock or is:hunter.
I have it set to 63 for all classes by default. Personally I set basestat:total:>=(xx) to 65 for my main characters and 63 for non-main characters.
