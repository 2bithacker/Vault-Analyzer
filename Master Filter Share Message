**TMMania's Master Filter: For filtering your armor & weapons. __This highlights your trash__, anything non-highlighted is an interesting roll for you to evaluate and decide to keep.**

__Copy and paste the code in this link into your DIM search bar and click any character emblem and select "Transfer Search" and **dismantle highlighted items**.__
**__Link:__** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TMMania/TMManias-DIM-Filter-Gallery/main/Master%20Filter
I recommend emptying your character’s weapon & armor inventory before using the filter, manually or via loadout.

This filter will keep __armor__ under the following conditions:
- **Tagged: Keep / Favorite / Archive / Infuse: (__Sunset armor without tags will be highlighted__)**
- Highest Light Level items (Armor and Weapons, one of each slot)
- **All** Exotics
- Loadout Items
- Titan: 18+ Recovery
- Hunter: (18+ Mobility **and** 13+ recovery)  __or__ (18+ Recovery) 
- Warlock: (18+ Discipline **and** 17+ recovery)
- All armor with 63+ stat rolls
- 15/20 Stat Pair w/ MW
- Triple 15 Stat Set w/ MW 
- Equal Stat Distribution
- One of every class item, Tag Keep to save more.

Weapons:
- Weapons that are sunset or have the Junk tag or blues will be highlighted to be dismantled while ignoring max LL items.
- Pinnacles, Rituals, weapons tagged keep and all MW'ed weapons that are sunset will be ignored.

**New Item Checker:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TMMania/TMManias-DIM-Filter-Gallery/main/New%20Item%20Checking
**__This it’s own filter, turn on New Item Dots for this filter!__**
__This requires you to avoid clicking new items in DIM, if you do click on something, tag it "Junk" if you're going to dismantle it.__
Highlights new items (armor and weapons) to be trashed or kept while ignoring your highest LL weapons and armor.
