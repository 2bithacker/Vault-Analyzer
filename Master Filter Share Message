**TMMania's Master Filter: For filtering your armor & weapons. __This highlights your trash__, anything non-highlighted is an interesting roll for you to evaluate and decide to keep.**

__Copy and paste the code in this link into your DIM search bar and click any character emblem and select "Transfer Search" and dismantle highlighted items.__
**__Link:__** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TMMania/TMManias-DIM-Filter-Gallery/main/Master%20Filter

This filter will keep __armor__ under the following conditions:
- **Tagged: Keep / Favorite / Archive [Please Use Tags]**
- Non-Sunset Armor (__Sunset armor without tags will be highlighted__)
- Highest Light Level items (Armor and Weapons, one of each slot)
- All Exotics (Weapons and Armor) 
- Loadout Items
- Titan: 18+ Recovery
- Hunter: (18+ Mobility **and** 13+ recovery)  __or__ (18+ Recovery) 
- Warlock: (18+ Discipline **and** 17+ recovery)
- All armor with 63+ stat rolls (keep reading)
- 15/20 Stat Pair w/ MW
- Triple 15 Stat Set w/ MW 
- Equal Stat Distribution
- One of every class item. Again, please use Keep / Favorite / Archive Tags


Weapons:
- Weapons that are sunset or have the Junk tag or blues will be highlighted to be dismantled, this filter will keep 1 max power blue for each slot.
- Pinnacles, Rituals and all MW'ed weapons that are sunset will be ignored.

You can modify the stat total filter for armor in the sections that start with is:class. 
Personally I set basestat:total:>=(xx) to 65 for my main characters and 63 for non-main characters.

**New Weapon Checker:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TMMania/TMManias-DIM-Filter-Gallery/main/New%20Weapon%20Checking
Highlights new weapons while ignoring your highest Light Level blues.
