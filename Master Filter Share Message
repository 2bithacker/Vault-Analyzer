**TMMania's Master Filter: For filtering your armor & weapons. __This highlights your trash__, anything non-highlighted is an interesting roll for you to decide to keep.**

__Copy and paste the code in this link into your DIM search bar and click your character's emblem and select "Transfer Search" and **dismantle highlighted items**.__
**__Link:__** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TMMania/TMManias-DIM-Filter-Gallery/main/Master%20Filter
I recommend emptying your character’s weapon & armor inventory before using the filter, manually or via loadout.

Ignored Weapons & Armor:
- **Tagged: Keep / Favorite / Archive / Infuse: (__Sunset items without any of these tags are highlighted__)**
- Highest Light Level items (one of each slot when below season cap, keeps all items at cap)
- All Exotics
- Loadout Items
- All MW'ed Items

This filter will keep __armor__ under the following conditions:
- Titan: 18+ Recovery
- Hunter: (18+ Mobility **and** 13+ recovery)  __or__ (18+ Recovery) 
- Warlock: (17+ Discipline **and** 18+ recovery)
- All armor with 63+ stat rolls
- 15/20 Stat Pair w/ MW
- Triple 15 Stat Set w/ MW 
- Equal Stat Distribution
- One of every class item, Tag Keep to save more.

Weapons that are sunset without tags or any weapons with the Junk tag and blues will be highlighted to be dismantled while ignoring max LL items.

**New Item Checker:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TMMania/TMManias-DIM-Filter-Gallery/main/New%20Item%20Checking
**__This it’s own filter, turn on New Item Dots for this filter!__**
__This requires you to avoid clicking new items in DIM, you can either dismantle or tag junk and it'll get caught by your next Master Filter search.__
Highlights items you haven't inspected, ignores max LL items.
