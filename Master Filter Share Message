This filter will keep __armor__ under the following conditions:
- **Tagged: Keep / Favorite / Archive: (__Sunset armor without tags will be highlighted__)**
- Highest Light Level items (Armor and Weapons, one of each slot)
- All Exotics (Weapons and Armor) 
- Loadout Items
- Titan: 18+ Recovery

- 15/20 Stat Pair w/ MW
- Triple 15 Stat Set w/ MW 
- Equal Stat Distribution
- One of every class item, use Keep tag to save additional copies.

Weapons:
- I do not have any filtering for perks, you have to look at your weapon rolls
- Weapons that are sunset or have the Junk tag or blues will be highlighted to be dismantled, this filter will keep 1 max power blue for each slot.
- Pinnacles, Rituals and all MW'ed weapons that are sunset will be ignored.

**New Item Checker:** https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TMMania/TMManias-DIM-Filter-Gallery/main/New%20Item%20Checking
**__Turn on New Item Dots for this filter__**
__This requires you to avoid clicking new items in DIM, if you do click on something, tag it "Junk" if you're going to dismantle it.__
Highlights new items while ignoring your highest LL weapons, these are the leftovers that should be decided to be trashed or kept by the player.
